#  score, also known as the coefficient of determination, is a meas‚Äê
# ure of goodness of a prediction for a regression model, and yields a score between 0
# and 1. A value of 1 corresponds to a perfect prediction, and a value of 0 corresponds
# to a constant model that just predicts the mean of the training set responses, y_train:
